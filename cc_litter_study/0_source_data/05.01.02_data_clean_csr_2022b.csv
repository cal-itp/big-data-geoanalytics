Your concern has been submitted and is currently being investigated. From your narrative, the litter located on Bonnyview is on the city right of way, not the state's, so we would be unable to remove or patrol that roadway, but the litter on highway 273 and I-5 will be removed.  We submitted the request for the Bonnyview litter to the city on your behalf and recommend following up with the Public Works department at 530-225-4170 or https://www.cityofredding.org/departments/public-works/streets/street-maintenance-request.",Tannersnan@charter.net,"jennifer.baldwin@dot.ca.gov,roger.g.lucas.jr@dot.ca.gov","jennifer.baldwin@dot.ca.gov,roger.g.lucas.jr@dot.ca.gov",,,Teri Buck,,4.0,,11.0,11.0,10.589,,There is lots of trash along hwy 273 especially from Bonneyview south up to clear creek road.

Caltrans is proceeding with clearing encampments if there is an immediate threat to safety or critical infrastructure. Crews will coordinate the cleaning of trash and debris around encampments while assessing safety situations. The department also continues to work with local governments and partners that help connect people with resources and move people into shelter/housing solutions as available. Complaints regarding alleged criminal activity and public safety concerns occurring at or near the encampment should be directed to law enforcement. **",Raquelrock9@yahoo.com,"Jose.Alcala.Jr@dot.ca.gov,Stephen.Palmer@dot.ca.gov,jose.rizo@dot.ca.gov,leonard.sauceda@dot.ca.gov","Jose.Alcala.Jr@dot.ca.gov,Stephen.Palmer@dot.ca.gov,jose.rizo@dot.ca.gov,leonard.sauceda@dot.ca.gov",,,,,1.0,,,1.0,17.239,,"Not sure if it’s a homeless encampment or if they left and left all their trash but there is trash, clothes, shopping cart, crap everywhere.",33.131016,-117.093742,

Caltrans removed 267,000 cubic yards of trash in 2020 — enough to fill 18,000 garbage trucks. On May 15, Governor Gavin Newsom announced the Clean California Initiative—a sweeping three-year initiative to remove litter and engage communities on beautification efforts through job creation and education. Clean California is a more than $1 billion, multi-year initiative to address litter while transforming unsightly roadsides into spaces with sustainable beautification projects that are places of pride. Clean California will remove an additional 1.2 million cubic yards, or 21,000 tons, of trash each year from the state highway system alone. The Caltrans Adopt-A-Highway Program also provides an avenue for individuals, organizations, or businesses to help maintain sections of roadside within California's State Highway System. For more information, please go to https://dot.ca.gov/programs/maintenance/adopt-a-highway.
