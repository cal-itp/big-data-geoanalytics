Lamon Construction Co. of Yuba City will be grinding down rough sections of pavement on I-80 between Douglas Boulevard in Roseville and Sierra College Boulevard in Rocklin. Heavy rains over the winter deteriorated the pavement in this area, and a $5.1 million emergency contract was executed for repair work. The contractor will perform grinding work from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Sunday through Thursday next week on sections of both eastbound and westbound I-80 in the outside #3 and #4 lanes. Motorists can expect alternating lane and ramp closures. Construction crews will return to perform paving work in early May (weather permitting).

In the meantime, our maintenance crews are visiting sites throughout the county to assist with trash pickup. At this time, we can’t give a date on when the encampment will be removed, however please know that your request is still active, and will be discussed in detail by the Task Force; as a unit, we will develop a plan to assist those in encampments, while cleaning up your area of concern, and others in the area.
