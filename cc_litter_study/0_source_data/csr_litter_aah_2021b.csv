Caltrans removed 267,000 cubic yards of trash in 2020 — enough to fill 18,000 garbage trucks.

Clean California is a more than $1 billion, multi-year initiative to address litter while transforming unsightly roadsides into spaces with sustainable beautification projects that are places of pride. Clean California will remove an additional 1.2 million cubic yards, or 21,000 tons, of trash each year from the state highway system alone. The Caltrans Adopt-A-Highway Program also provides an avenue for individuals, organizations, or businesses to help maintain sections of roadside within California's State Highway System.

Clean California will remove an additional 1.2 million cubic yards, or 21,000 tons, of trash each year from the state highway system alone.
