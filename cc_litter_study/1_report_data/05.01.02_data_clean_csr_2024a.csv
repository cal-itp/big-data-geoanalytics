In the meantime, our maintenance crews are visiting sites throughout the county to assist with trash pickup. At this time, we can’t give a date on when the encampment will be removed, however please know that your request is still active, and will be discussed in detail by the Task Force; as a unit, we will develop a plan to assist those in encampments, while cleaning up your area of concern, and others in the area.
