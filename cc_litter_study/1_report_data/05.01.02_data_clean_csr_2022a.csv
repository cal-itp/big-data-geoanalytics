Through our collaboration, we are trying to find housing solutions for the homeless that will hopefully become permanent and sustainable.  In the meantime, our maintenance crews are visiting sites throughout the county to assist with trash pickup. At this time we can’t give a date on when the encampment will be removed, however please know that your request is still active, and will be discussed in detail by the Task Force;  as a unit, we will develop a plan to assist those in encampments, while cleaning up your area of concern, and others in the area.

It’s an effort we’re making to keep everyone updated on areas of concern in District 10.  Through our collaboration, we are trying to find housing solutions for the homeless that will hopefully become permanent and sustainable.  In the meantime, our maintenance crews are visiting sites throughout the county to assist with trash pickup. At this time we can’t give a date on when the encampment will be removed, however please know that your request is still active, and will be discussed in detail by the Task Force;  as a unit, we will develop a plan to assist those in encampments, while cleaning up your area of concern, and others in the area.

The responsible Region Area Superintendent and Supervisor have been notified and will investigate your concern. Scheduling and completion of the reported issue may be affected by several factors, including available resources, safety issues, and priority level. Caltrans removed 267,000 cubic yards of trash in 2020 — enough to fill 18,000 garbage trucks. On May 15, Governor Gavin Newsom announced the Clean California Initiative—a sweeping three-year initiative to remove litter and engage communities on beautification efforts through job creation and education. Clean California is a more than $1 billion, multi-year initiative to address litter while transforming unsightly roadsides into spaces with sustainable beautification projects that are places of pride. Clean California will remove an additional 1.2 million cubic yards, or 21,000 tons, of trash each year from the state highway system alone. The Caltrans Adopt-A-Highway Program also provides an avenue for individuals, organizations, or businesses to help maintain sections of roadside within California's State Highway System. For more information please go to https://dot.ca.gov/programs/maintenance/adopt-a-highway.

On May 15, Governor Gavin Newsom announced the Clean California Initiative—a sweeping three-year initiative to remove litter and engage communities on beautification efforts through job creation and education. Clean California is a more than $1 billion, multi-year initiative to address litter while transforming unsightly roadsides into spaces with sustainable beautification projects that are places of pride. Clean California will remove an additional 1.2 million cubic yards, or 21,000 tons, of trash each year from the state highway system alone. The Caltrans Adopt-A-Highway Program also provides an avenue for individuals, organizations, or businesses to help maintain sections of roadside within California's State Highway System. For more information please go to https://dot.ca.gov/programs/maintenance/adopt-a-highway.

As this is a duplicate request, your concerns will be addressed under CSR# 862124 and this duplicate ticket will be closed. The responsible Region Area Superintendent and Supervisor have been notified and will investigate your concern. Scheduling and completion of the reported issue may be affected by several factors, including available resources, safety issues, and priority level. Caltrans removed 267,000 cubic yards of trash in 2020 — enough to fill 18,000 garbage trucks. On May 15, Governor Gavin Newsom announced the Clean California Initiative—a sweeping three-year initiative to remove litter and engage communities on beautification efforts through job creation and education. Clean California is a more than $1 billion, multi-year initiative to address litter while transforming unsightly roadsides into spaces with sustainable beautification projects that are places of pride. Clean California will remove an additional 1.2 million cubic yards, or 21,000 tons, of trash each year from the state highway system alone. The Caltrans Adopt-A-Highway Program also provides an avenue for individuals, organizations, or businesses to help maintain sections of roadside within California's State Highway System.

Caltrans removed 267,000 cubic yards of trash in 2020 — enough to fill 18,000 garbage trucks. On May 15, Governor Gavin Newsom announced the Clean California Initiative—a sweeping three-year initiative to remove litter and engage communities on beautification efforts through job creation and education. Clean California is a more than $1 billion, multi-year initiative to address litter while transforming unsightly roadsides into spaces with sustainable beautification projects that are places of pride. Clean California will remove an additional 1.2 million cubic yards, or 21,000 tons, of trash each year from the state highway system alone. The Caltrans Adopt-A-Highway Program also provides an avenue for individuals, organizations, or businesses to help maintain sections of roadside within California's State Highway System.

We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with your concerns and value your submission; however, the CSR reporting program can only process one request at a time for a limited area, so different locations need to be reported separately as they may go to different groups. Additionally, specific locations are required as different districts manage different roadways. As we are not able to pinpoint a specific location based on the provided description, your ticket will be closed. We invite you to submit tickets for specific locations that are most in need of attention (e.g., Hwy 280 near Page Mill Rd, or Hwy 280 between El Monte Rd and Magdalena Ave) and we will add them to our queue for processing.  The Caltrans Adopt-A-Highway Program also provides an avenue for individuals, organizations, or businesses to help maintain sections of roadside within California's State Highway System.

When it is scheduled, the abatement of the nearby active encampment will include the removal of litter and debris. Consistent with CDC guidance to prevent community spread of COVID-19, Caltrans is proceeding with encampment cleanups if there is an immediate safety concern or threat to critical infrastructure. We will continue to work with cities and other partners to move people into safer situations as available. Caltrans continues to use hazardous materials collectors to clean trash from areas around encampments. However, Caltrans must also allocate resources to maintaining the state highway system and cannot immediately address trash collection at the thousands of encampments throughout the state. Caltrans does not have any law enforcement powers, so please report any illegal activity or fire related concerns immediately by calling 911 and including the nearby highway information for reference purposes.

Caltrans removed 267,000 cubic yards of trash in 2020 — enough to fill 18,000 garbage trucks. On May 15, 2021 Governor Gavin Newsom announced the Clean California Initiative—a sweeping three-year initiative to remove litter and engage communities on beautification efforts through job creation and education. Clean California is a more than $1 billion, multi-year initiative to address litter while transforming unsightly roadsides into spaces with sustainable beautification projects that are places of pride. Clean California will remove an additional 1.2 million cubic yards, or 21,000 tons, of trash each year from the state highway system alone. The Caltrans Adopt-A-Highway Program also provides an avenue for individuals, organizations, or businesses to help maintain sections of roadside within California's State Highway System.
