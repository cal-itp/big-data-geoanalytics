Caltrans staff coordinates with local government agencies that are funded, trained, and equipped to help people sheltering on state right-of-way; those local agencies and their providers conduct outreach to connect people experiencing homelessness with essential services and available shelter/housing options. Caltrans also works with law enforcement agencies for the safety of the public, employees, and people experiencing homelessness. Caltrans is not a law enforcement agency; complaints regarding alleged criminal activity and public safety concerns occurring at or near the encampment should be directed to law enforcement.Once local outreach providers and law enforcement have completed their work, Caltrans crews and Hazmat contractors are responsible for removing any remaining debris.
