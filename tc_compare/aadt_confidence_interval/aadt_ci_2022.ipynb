    "\n",
    "Interpretation\n",
    "The confidence interval includes zero, which implies that the average difference between the non-traditional and true AADT estimates is not statistically significant. This means that, on average, the non-traditional estimates neither consistently overestimate nor underestimate the true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relatively narrow confidence interval (approximately ±5%) indicates that the non-traditional AADT estimates are reasonably precise and closely align with the true AADT values.\n",

    "Practical Implications\n",
    "Accuracy: The non-traditional AADT estimates are, on average, very close to the true values, with only a slight underestimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: The narrow confidence interval suggests that the estimates are consistently close to the true values across different samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability: Given the small mean error and narrow confidence interval, non-traditional AADT estimation methods can be considered reliable for practical applications."

    "### Understanding the Metrics\n",
    "* Traffic Count Error (TCE) quantifies the percentage difference between AADT estimates from non-traditional sources and true AADT values from permanent counters.\n",
    "* Mean TCE of -54.48% indicates that, on average, the non-traditional AADT estimates are 54.48% lower than the true AADT values. This suggests a substantial underestimation.\n",
    "* 95% Confidence Interval of (-59.26%, -49.71%) means that we can be 95% confident that the true mean TCE lies within this range. In other words, if we were to repeat this sampling process multiple times, 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true mean TCE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "* The confidence interval does not include zero, which implies that the average difference between the non-traditional and true AADT estimates is statistically significant. This means that the non-traditional estimates consistently underestimate the true values.\n",
    "* The relatively narrow confidence interval (approximately ±5%) indicates that the non-traditional AADT estimates are consistently underestimating the true values across different samples.\n",
    "### Practical Implications\n",
    "* Accuracy: The non-traditional AADT estimates are significantly lower than the true values, with an average underestimation of over 50%.\n",
    "* Precision: The narrow confidence interval suggests that this underestimation is consistent across different observations.\n",
    "* Reliability: Given the significant and consistent underestimation, non-traditional AADT estimation methods may not be reliable without adjustments or calibrations.\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "* Investigate Potential Causes: Examine the methodology of the non-traditional data sources to identify factors contributing to the underestimation.\n",
    "* Calibration: Consider applying correction factors or calibration techniques to adjust the non-traditional estimates closer to the true values.\n",
    "* Supplement with Additional Data: Use supplementary data sources or methods to validate and enhance the accuracy of the non-traditional AADT estimates."
