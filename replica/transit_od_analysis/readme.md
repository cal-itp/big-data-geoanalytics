# Transit Origin-Destination Analysis with Big Data

* Goal is to understand traveler patterns, where they are going to and from, when and what modes. 
* Using Big Data Platforms, we can get more data than the AADT, and understand whole trips that are happening around or along transit areas. 
* With previously developed utils, we can easily interpret the data we download from these OD analyses.
